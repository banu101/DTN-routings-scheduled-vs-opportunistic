# DTN-routings-scheduled-vs-opportunistic
Capstone Project code

The code modifies the data taken from online DTN simulator (https://wanderowski.github.io/web-simulator/). On top of that, it identifies transmissions between nodes, and based on that information it provides the traffic load (number of transmissions) and the shortest path (if exists) from source node to destination node in the simulated network.

The Excel sheet namings stand for simData_numberofsetnodes_iteration.
